# undergroundrailroad_bytehacks

## Inspiration
Our inspiration was definetly the Civil Rights movement. But that is too vague so we decided one of the biggest accomplishments in related to that topic, the Underground Railroad.

## What it does
Our app would have allowed the slaves to run away worry free and reserve spots in safehouses allowing them to have a safe, planned trip. There is always the probability that safehouses are taken over. But there is a solution for that too. Whenever a safehouse is taken over, it can be marked as unsafe.

## How we built it
To make this happen, we had to use a variety of applications. The apps we used are Flutter, Firebase, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Dart, and of course Github. Using all of these, we were able to make an entire app in 4 days. We all worked on different parts because we are all in different places and working at different times. Despite this, we were able to make an app using Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into
We definetely ran into problems some of which were we all lived in different places, meaning we were not always working at the same time. Another challenge we faced was getting the users location. We also had trouble displaying the lines of the route between the user's location and the destination safehouse.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was really hard to access the database, but we did it!! We were able to route ourselves to get access to the database.
